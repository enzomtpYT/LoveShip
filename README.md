# LoveShip 💘

**LoveShip** is an AI-powered romantic compatibility calculator that goes beyond simple zodiac signs. It invites couples to take a psychological deep-dive survey, then uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze their synergy, predict their future, and offer relationship advice.

 ✨ **100% AI-Generated Code**
> **Note:** This entire application—including all logic, UI design, styling, and documentation—was written exclusively by **Google Gemini**, with no manual coding by human developers.
